# Vet Clinic
This milestone of the Vet clinic database project, `Query and update Animals table` helps us exercise on altering table columns like adding columns, updating the fields, transactions using `BEGIN`, `SAVEPOINT`, `ROLLBACK`, and `COMMIT` sql statements. In addition, this milestone of the project helps us exercise on aggregate sql statements like `min`, `max`, `avg`, `count` and `group by`.


## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**
