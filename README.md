# Vet Clinic Database

This milestone of the Vet clinic database project, `Query multiple tables` helps us exercise on adding foreign keys for the already created table that references to other tables, on populating data in the related tables, and write queries using `JOIN` and aggregate sql statements like `GROUP BY` to fetch the data based on the project requirement.


## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**
