# Vet Clinic Database

This milestone of the Vet clinic database project, `ADD join table` helps us understand many-to-many relationships in a SQL database. In this milestone, creating join tables, populating the jojn tables with the given data, and interstingly complex query sql statements are written to retrieve important information from the database.


## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**
